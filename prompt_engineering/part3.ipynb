      "API rate limiting is a critical mechanism for safeguarding APIs by controlling the volume of requests a user or application can make within a given timeframe (e.g., per minute or hour). Imagine a popular e-commerce API: Without rate limiting, a malicious bot could flood the API with requests, potentially crashing the service and preventing legitimate users from accessing it. Rate limiting prevents this abuse, protects against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and ensures fair resource allocation. These limits are typically enforced based on user ID, API key, or IP address. When a limit is exceeded, the API responds with a \"429 Too Many Requests\" error, informing the user to retry after a specific period. Algorithms like the token bucket or leaky bucket are commonly used to implement these controls, providing nuanced approaches to traffic shaping and API protection.\n",
